# Packlink Pro API client for Crystal

Compare Courier Services or Send a Parcel with Packlink. This is the unofficial
[Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) shard for Packlink.

## Installation

Add packlink as a depencency to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  packlink:
    github: tilishop/packlink.cr
```

Then run `shards install`.

## Usage

### Configuring the API key

To configure it globally, create an initializer and add the following line:

```crystal
Packlink.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "<your-api-key>"
end
```

You can also include a client instance in each request you make:

```crystal
client = Packlink::Client.new("<your-api-key>")
shipments = Packlink::Shipment
  .from("GB", "BN2 1JJ")
  .to("BE", 2000)
  .package({width: 40, height: 30, length: 25, weight: 5})
  .all(client: client)
```

If you need to do multiple calls with the same API Key, use the following helper:

```crystal
Packlink::Client.with_api_key("<your-api-key>") do |packlink|
  from_gb_to_be = packlink.shipment
    .from("GB", "BN2 1JJ").to("BE", 2000)
    .package({width: 40, height: 30, length: 25, weight: 5}).all
  from_de_to_fr = packlink.shipment
    .package({width: 40, height: 30, length: 25, weight: 5})
    .package({width: 10, height: 10, length: 10, weight: 1})
    .from("DE", 10587).to("FR", 75013).all
end
```

### Registration and Authentication

User management is only required if you are creating accounts for other users.
For example, in a situation where other users can create an account for Packlink
through your platform or plugin.

#### Register a new user:

```crystal
temporary_token = Packlink::Register.user({
  email:                     "myaccount@packlink.com",
  estimated_delivery_volume: "1 - 10",
  ip:                        "123.123.123.123",
  password:                  "myPassword",
  phone:                     "+447987654321",
  platform:                  "PRO",
  platform_country:          "GB",
  policies:                  {
    terms_and_conditions: true,
    data_processing:      true,
    marketing_emails:     true,
    marketing_calls:      true,
  },
  referral: {
    onboarding_product:     "dummy",
    onboarding_sub_product: "sub_dummy",
  },
  source: "https://urlwhereregistrationoffered",
})

puts temporary_token # => e0f90eacfa678e20051c3a5bc2bcc05a...
```

#### Activation

Using the temporary token obtained at registration, check if the user is
activated.

```crystal
active = Packlink::User.active?("e0f90eac...")
```

If the user is not active, the permanent api token can be obtained as follows:

```crystal
unless Packlink::User.active?("e0f90eac...")
  permanent_token = Packlink::User.activate("e0f90eac...")
  puts permanent_token # => fa678e20...
end
```

#### Logging in

If a given user already has a Packlink Pro account, the API key can be retreived
by logging in:

```crystal
token = Packlink::Auth.login({
  email:            "myaccount@packlink.com",
  password:         "myPassword",
  platform:         "pro",
  platform_country: "gb",
})
puts token # => fa678e20...
```

#### Password reset
If a given user has an account but forgot their password, a password reset link
can be requested:

```crystal
Packlink::Auth.reset_password({
  email:            "myaccount@packlink.com",
  platform:         "pro",
  platform_country: "gb",
})
```

*__Note:__ This will never fail and there is no response. If the email address
exists, an email will arrive. If not, nothing will happen.*

### Get Services

You need a source (`from`), destination (`to`) and at least one `package`:

```crystal
services = Packlink::Service
  .from("GB", "BN2 1JJ")
  .to("BE", 9000)
  .package({width: 15, height: 15, length: 15, weight: 1.5})
  .all

service = services.first

service.id                                  # => 20154
service.carrier_name                        # => "DPD"
service.name                                # => "Classic Kleinpaket"
service.price.total_price                   # => 3.94
service.price.currency                      # => "EUR"
service.transit_hours                       # => "24"
service.available_dates["2020/03/30"].from  # => "08:00"
service.available_dates["2020/03/30"].till  # => "18:00"
service.available_dates["2020/03/30"].to_s  # => "08:00-18:00"
...
```

*__Note:__ For a full list if available fields, check the
[services spec fixture](https://github.com/tilishop/packlink.cr/blob/master/spec/fixtures/services/all-response.json).* 

You can also add multiple packages and the order of the method chain is not
important:

```crystal
services = Packlink::Service
  .package({width: 40, height: 30, length: 25, weight: 5})
  .from("GB", "BN2 1JJ")
  .package({width: 15, height: 15, length: 15, weight: 1.5})
  .to("BE", 9000)
  .package({width: 20, height: 15, length: 10, weight: 3})
  .all
```

With an instance of a `Packlink::Package` object:

```crystal
package = Packlink::Package.build({
  width: 40,
  height: 30,
  length: 25,
  weight: 5
})
services = Packlink::Service
  .package(package)
  .from("GB", "BN2 1JJ")
  .to("BE", 9000)
  .all
```

For more clarity, or a different order, use named arguments:

```crystal
services = Packlink::Service
  .package(package)
  .from(country: "GB", zip: "BN2 1JJ")
  .to(country: "BE", zip: 9000)
  .all
```

Finally, you can also avoid the method chain and use a named tuple or hash:

```crystal
services = Packlink::Service.all(query: {
  from:     {country: "DE", zip: 56457},
  to:       {country: "BE", zip: 9000},
  packages: {
    "0": {width: 10, height: 10, length: 10, weight: 1},
  },
})
```

Or even:

```crystal
services = Packlink::Service.all(query: {
  from:     {country: "DE", zip: 56457},
  to:       {country: "BE", zip: 9000},
  packages: {
    "0": Packlink::Package.build({width: 40, height: 30, length: 25, weight: 5}),
  },
})
```

### Get available services details

If you know the id of a service, its details can be fetched as follows:

```crystal
service = Packlink::Service.find(20154)
```

### Get Dropoffs

Gives you a list of the ten closest dropoff points.

```crystal
dropoffs = Packlink::Dropoff.all({
  service_id: 21369,
  country:    "GB",
  zip:        "BN2 1JJ",
})

dropoff = dropoffs.first

dropoff.address               # => "52 St. George's Road"
dropoff.city                  # => "Brighton"
dropoff.commerce_name         # => "St. Georges News"
dropoff.id                    # => "S16271"
dropoff.lat                   # => 50.817563999999997
dropoff.long                  # => -0.118057
dropoff.opening_times.monday  # => "06:00-21:00"
dropoff.phone                 # => "07461451073"
dropoff.zip                   # => "BN2 1EF"
```

### Create Order

Creates a new order. Each order can include several shipments.

An order consists of multiple parts, and that is how one should be built. It is
also possible to use one large `Hash` or `NamedTuple`. But using the method
below ensures type safety and completeness of the posted data.

```crystal
# 1. Build one or more packages
package = Packlink::Package.build({
  width: 15,
  height: 15,
  length: 10,
  weight: 1
})

# 2. Build a source address
from_address = Packlink::Address.build({
  city:     "Cannes",
  country:  "FR",
  email:    "test@packlink.com",
  name:     "TestName",
  phone:    "0666559988",
  state:    "FR",
  street1:  "Suffren 3",
  surname:  "TestLastName",
  zip_code: "06400",
})

# 3. Build a destination address
to_address = Packlink::Address.build({
  city:     "Paris",
  country:  "FR",
  email:    "test@packlink.com",
  name:     "TestName",
  phone:    "630465777",
  state:    "FR",
  street1:  "Avenue Marchal 1",
  surname:  "TestLastName",
  zip_code: "75001",
})

# 3b. Build a customs object (only required for shipments outside the EU)
customs = Packlink::Shipment::Customs.build({
  eori_number:       "GB123456789000",
  sender_personalid: "EX123456",
  sender_type:       "private",
  shipment_type:     "gift",
  vat_number:        "GB123456789",
  items:             [{
    description_english: "Hairdryer",
    quantity:            2,
    weight:              1.3,
    value:               33.5,
    country_of_origin:   "GB",
  }],
})

# 4. Build shipment (can be multiple within one order)
shipment = Packlink::Order::Shipment.build({
  from:                       from_address,
  to:                         to_address,
  packages:                   [package],
  customs:                    customs,
  content:                    "Test content",
  contentvalue:               160,
  dropoff_point_id:           "062049",
  service_id:                 20149,
  shipment_custom_reference:  "69a280b2-f7db-11e6-915e-5c54c4398ed2",
  source:                     "source_inbound",
})

# 5. Create order
order = Packlink::Order.create({
  order_custom_reference: "Beautiful leggins from eBay",
  shipments:              [shipment]
})

# If everything went well, you will receive an order summary:

order.order_reference             # => "DE00019732CF"
order.total_amount                # => 4.9

line = order.shipments.first      # => Packlink::Order::ShipmentLine

line.shipment_custom_reference    # => "eBay_11993382332"
line.shipment_reference           # => "DE000193392AB"
line.insurance_coverage_amount    # => 750.0
line.total_price                  # => 4.9
line.receipt                      # => "http://url/to/receipt"
```

### Create Draft

Creates a new draft shipment. Building a draft shipment is exactly the same as
building a shipment for an order, except that in a draft, all fields are
optional.

```crystal
draft = Packlink::Draft.create({
  from:                       from_address,
  to:                         to_address,
  packages:                   [package],
  content:                    "Test content",
  contentvalue:               160,
  dropoff_point_id:           "062049",
  service_id:                 20149,
  shipment_custom_reference:  "69a280b2-f7db-11e6-915e-5c54c4398ed2",
  source:                     "source_inbound",
})

draft.shipment_reference   # => "DE00019732CF"
```

### Get Labels

Returns the shipping labels in PDF format (A4) for the given shipment
reference:

```crystal
labels = Packlink::Label.all("ES00019388AB")

labels.first   # => "http://packlink.de/de/purchase/PostVenta/getLabelsByRef?ref=52cfc1a841..."
```

*__Note:__ In many cases, there will only be one shipping label.*

### Get Customs

Returns the shipping customs PDF url.

```crystal
pdf = Packlink::Customs.pdf("DE2015API0000003515")

pdf   # => "http://static.packitos.com/prodev-pro/customs/c24a19d1bf25df8..."
```

### Get Shipment Details

Returns the shipping details.

```crystal
shipment = Packlink::Shipment.find("DE2015API0000003515")

shipment.base_price         # => 15.85
shipment.carrier            # => "Mondial Relay"
shipment.collection.city    # => "Paris"
shipment.collection.name    # => "Daniel Werner"
shipment.collection_date    # => "2015-04-16"
shipment.collection_hour    # => "00:00-24:00"
...
```
